This is a project on chess openings and learned how to use and apply libraries to analyze data.

Stuff learned :
pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, beautifulsoup

Overview - 

We tried to find that if given an elo is there an optimal opening that would lead to a higher win percentage, because there are many types of openings that could be risky or just safe. We cleaned our data into seperate skill brackets and were not able to find any correlation between elo and openings that would lead to a higher win percentage. But interestingly enough, we found that most openings generally stayed around the same win rate, so using a opening could work in different skill levels, as long as it isn't too outlandish
